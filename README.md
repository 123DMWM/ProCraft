This is a custom server based on [fCraft](https://github.com/fragmer/fCraft) but with tons of extra features and complete [CPE](http://wiki.vg/CPE) support unlike other servers with partial support.

I suggest you **do not** use this server unless you know what you are doing. There are still lots to do and some hardcoded-ish stuff that needs to be removed.
