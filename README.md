This is my mess of a server based on a really old fork of fcraft, I have added almost full CPE support, I have added a whole lot of noew commands. I just wanted to put it on here for the general public to laugh at since it's so bad XD

There is a few Hard-Coded things, Find them all and win a Prize! (Prize: You get to change it to your own hard-coded stuff!) But yea, in the future I will make the current hard-coded things able to be changed via commands or configgui.
