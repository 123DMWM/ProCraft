This is my custom classic minecraft server forked from an old fCraft repo which I have updated as much as I could. It has and will always have all the latest [CPE](http://wiki.vg/CPE) functions. I highly suggest you only use this repo to take code from because the server is mainly suited to my needs and has a few difficulties I would rather not take the time to simplify.

Download compiled server(last warning: I suggest you do not use this software) [**`HERE`**](http://123dmwm.tk/Random/ProCraft.zip) - (Always up to date with latest WORKING code - Latest: April 13, 2015)
