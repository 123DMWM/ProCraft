This is my custom classic minecraft server forked from an old fCraft repo which I have updated as much as I could. It has and will always have all the latest [CPE](http://wiki.vg/CPE) functions. I highly suggest you only use this repo to take code from because the server is mainly suited to my needs and has a few difficulties I would rather not take the time to simplify.
